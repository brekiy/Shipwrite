# Shipwrite

Simple Unity game created at the 2017 Pumpkin Game Jam at the University of Michigan as part of a 4 person team

## Mechanics

* Collect letters with the ship to make words
* Longer words get more score
* If letters are collected that don't make a word in the dictionary, a life is deducted
* Game ends when there are no lives left

## Bugs

* Restarting the game after a loss either:
	* Takes an unreasonable amount of time
	* Crashes the game
	
This does not happen while in the Unity editor itself.
	
## Usage

The source Unity project is stored in the PumpkinGameJam folder.

There are builds for Windows and Mac OS already in the repository. 

Simply run the game from the executable.
