# Shipwrite

## Mechanics
-Collect letters with the ship to make words
-Longer words get more score
-If letters are collected that don't make a word in the dictionary, a life is deducted
-Game ends when there are no lives left

Bugs:
-Restarting the game after a loss either:
	-Takes an unreasonable amount of time
	-Crashes the game
