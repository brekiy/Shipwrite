# Shipwrite

Collect letters with the ship to make words
Longer words get more score
If letters are collected that don't make a word in the dictionary, a life is deducted
Game ends when there are no lives left

Bugs:
Restarting the game after a loss either takes an unreasonable amount of time or crashes the game
